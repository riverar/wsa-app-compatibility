## Note about Windows Subsystem for Android
The [Windows Subsystem for Android](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/android/wsa/) is no longer available in the Microsoft Store as of March 5, 2025.

## Issues / Support

We can't offer support for the Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) or Android apps.
Instead, try asking the folks that hang out in the [WSA subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WSA/). Good luck!

## Support table (OS features)

| Feature | Support level | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Multi-touch | ✅ | Demo: [Arcaea](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ph411n7M5)
| Virtual Wifi (VirtWifi) | ✅
| Bluetooth | ❌ ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/WSA/issues/103))
| IPv6 | ✅ | Loading `ipv6.google.com` in Fennec F-Droid on a PC with IPv6 access, works well
| Fingerprint Reader | ❌ | Test failed on ROG Flow X13, with SATRIA app
| VPN | ❌⚠️ | VPN Connection request dialog does not appear (but some VPNs may not need this, e.g., Tunnelbear)
| OpenGL ES 3.1 | ❌
| Vulkan | ✅ | Added as experimental feature in [2307.40000.2.0](https://github.com/microsoft/WSA/discussions/374)

### Workarounds

#### VPN

There is no `com.android.vpndialogs` in WSA. However, it's possible to manually grant the VPN activation permission with AppOps via `adb shell`:

```shell
appops set [package name] ACTIVATE_VPN allow
```

#### Launching Android Apps with URI scheme

Microsoft provides a custom URI scheme for WSA, making it easier to launch apps:

```shell
wsa://[App Package Name]
```

For example, to launch Apple Music in WSA, use:

```shell
wsa://com.apple.android.music
```

### Government
| Application | Latest tested version | Android versions | Support level | Known Issues | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| eGovPH | 2.3.5 | 13 | ⚠️ | Tested on 3 WSA builds, stock WSA, with GMS installed and no root/Magisk/KernelSU, and with GMS-Magisk/KernelSU installed ([WSABuilds non-LTS, no Magisk/root installed, 2311.40000.5.0](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds/releases/tag/Windows_11_2311.40000.5.0)), ([WSABuilds LTS, with GMS, KernelSU/Magisk installed, 2311.40000.5.0](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds/releases/tag/Windows_11_2311.40000.5.0_LTS_3)). It is also recommended to temporarily disable developer settings before starting the app. With Magisk/root installed, it would alert "This device is jailbroken, you cannot continue". If no GMS services are present, it will tell you "This device is not supported for required Google Play Services".  The app doesn't start properly if you didn't grant the permissions beforehand in Android settings. For eReport, the app can't progress beyond the Current Location permission prompt as clicking the "Enable Location" doesn't do anything (even with the location permission granted for WSA in Windows); the workaround is to access it via the Suggested eGovPH Services part (found on the Home tab), however, it is stuck in report details as it still checks for the location permission. eKYC verification is problematic for laptop users is wonky with eGovPH's image handling, affecting the verification process (this also applies if you're registering an account from the same device for its face verification). Some pages display no content (notably FAQs and application details in some cases) |  Basic features work such as navigating through the app features/pages. The PhilSys Digital ID page works as well and can recognize it in the verification site from another device. Recommended to use an up-to-date version of Android System WebView since the app mostly relies on it.

### Google apps

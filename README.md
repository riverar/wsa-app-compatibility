## Support table (OS features)

| Feature | Support level | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Multi-touch | ✅ | Demo: [Arcaea](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ph411n7M5) |
| Virtual Wifi (VirtWifi) | ✅ |  |
| Fingerprint Reader | ❌ | Test failed on ROG Flow X13, with SATRIA app |
| VPN | ❌ | VPN Connection request dialog does not appear |
| OpenGL ES 3.1 | ❌ | |

### Workarounds

#### VPN
There is no `com.android.vpndialogs` in WSA. However, it's possible to manually grant the VPN activation permission with AppOps via `adb shell`:
```shell
appops set [package name] ACTIVATE_VPN allow
```

#### Launching Android Apps with URI scheme
Microsoft provides a custom URI scheme for WSA, making it easier to launch apps:
```shell
wsa://[App Package Name]
```
For example, to launch Apple Music in WSA, use:
```shell
wsa://com.apple.android.music
```
Some URIs are not supported in WSA, such as:
```shell
wsa://com.android.settings
```
